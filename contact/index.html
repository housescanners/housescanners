      <h2>FAQ</h2>

    </section>

      <p><strong>How much do your home inspections cost?</strong><br>
        The home inspection fee is based on the age and square footage of the home. Every house is unique and for this reason we cannot put every price on here. Contact us with this information to receive an accurate quote. Our prices are competitive and fair, and the value of a quality home inspection greatly exceeds the cost.</p>

      <p><strong>When is the best time to schedule a home inspection?</strong><br>
        The sooner you put in a request, the better chances of securing the appointment date and time you would prefer. Scheduling can be tight during peak real estate months, but we will do our best to schedule a time that is mutually convenient and fits your deadline.</small></p>

      <p><strong>How can I prepare for a home inspection?</strong><br>
        The more information about the property you can send our way, the better prepared our inspectors will be when inspecting the home. MLS sheets are extremely helpful if they are available - they give us an indication of what we can expect to look for during the inspection. Also, making sure all utilities are turned on by the time of the inspection ensures a more complete inspection of the home's components, e.g. electricity, natural gas, public/private water supplies.</p>

      <p><strong>Should I attend the home inspection?</strong><br>
        We recommend that you attend the inspection, so you can see first hand everything we find. It's also a great opportunity to ask questions. Keep in mind, a full inspection lasts an average of 3 hours. Many people prefer to attend towards the end of the inspection for the report and walkthrough - less waiting on your end and the inspection process is less interrupted. However, you are more than welcome to attend the entire inspection. We enjoy the company!</p>

      <p><strong>What if I'm unable to attend the home inspection?</strong><br>
        We understand that work and living out of state makes attending the home inspection difficult. If your agent / representative is present, we will go over our findings with them and forward the report to you in an email. If you have questions, give our office a call or an email and we will be happy to answer them for you!</p>

      <p><strong>Can I perform a home inspection myself?</strong><br>
       The answer is yes, but it's recommended that a licensed home inspector assess the current condition of your property. We're trained, licensed, and have years of experience in this field. Some problems are obvious, but others take a trained eye to pick up on.</p>

       <p><small>Did these answer your questions? If not, feel free to contact us anytime. We look forward to hearing from you!</small></p>
